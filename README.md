# Tic Tac Go

I wrote this program to learn the basics of Golang. It's an interactive CLI version of Tic Tac Toe. The AI is very dumb.

Please feel free to suggest improvements to the code. 

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. `cd tictacgo`
3. `go build .`
4. `./tictacgo`

## Example

```Enter a number between 1 and 9:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
